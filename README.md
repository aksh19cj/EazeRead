# LangChain Workflow with Pinecone

This repository demonstrates a workflow that integrates LangChain with a vector store (Pinecone) to enable semantic search and question answering using large language models (LLMs).

## Overview

The workflow processes PDF documents to create embeddings, stores them in a vector store, and then uses these embeddings to provide accurate answers to user questions through semantic search.

## Workflow

1. **Document Input**:
   - Multiple PDF documents are the source of information.

2. **Chunking Text**:
   - Each PDF document is split into smaller chunks of text to facilitate efficient processing.

3. **Embeddings Creation**:
   - Each chunk of text is processed to create embeddings using a large language model (LLM). Embeddings are vector representations of the text chunks that capture the semantic meaning of the content.

4. **Storing Embeddings**:
   - The embeddings are stored in a vector store (Pinecone), which acts as a knowledge base for the documents.

5. **Question Embedding**:
   - When a user asks a question (e.g., "What is a neural network?"), the question is converted into an embedding using the LLM.

6. **Semantic Search**:
   - The question embedding is used to perform a semantic search against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This retrieves the most relevant text chunks based on the semantic similarity to the question.

7. **Ranking Results**:
   - The retrieved results are ranked based on their relevance to the question.

8. **Answer Generation**:
   - The LLM uses the ranked results to generate an answer to the user's question.

9. **User Interaction**:
   - The user receives the answer generated by the LLM.

## Components

- **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications with LLMs.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database service for storing and searching embeddings.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Used to create embeddings and generate answers.

## Setup and Installation
